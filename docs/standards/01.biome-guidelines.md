01 — Biome Guidelines

Purpose: To define a unified code style and linting standard for AI code generation and developer consistency across the React + Vite + TypeScript monorepo.

🇬🇧 Section 1: AI Coding Rules (for AI to follow)
1. General

Always ensure all code passes pnpm biome check . with zero errors or warnings.

Never disable Biome rules using // biome-ignore or similar comments unless explicitly instructed.

Code must be formatted automatically using Biome’s default formatter.

2. Import / Export Rules

Import order (strictly):

Node.js or global modules (e.g. react, react-dom, vite)

Third-party libraries (e.g. antd, @tanstack/react-query)

Internal shared packages (@ecolife/ui-core, @ecolife/design-tokens, etc.)

Local paths (../, ./)

Always use alphabetical order inside each import group.

Type-only imports must be written using import type.

import type { FC } from 'react';
import { Button } from 'antd';


Exports must be grouped and sorted alphabetically as well.

3. Formatting Rules

Use Biome’s auto-format: spaces around operators, commas, and brackets.

Keep JSX attributes on a single line if short; multiline only if exceeds 100 characters.

Arrays and objects should be compact unless readability suffers.

No trailing commas in single-line objects or arrays.

Use single quotes ' for strings.

End each file with a newline (\n).

4. Naming Conventions

Components: PascalCase (e.g. EmployeeCard.tsx)

Hooks: camelCase with use prefix (e.g. useCreateEmployee.ts)

Files with JSX must use .tsx; pure logic files use .ts.

Constants and enums: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

Functions, variables: camelCase

5. Code Quality

Avoid any — always infer or define explicit types.

Keep line length under 100 characters.

Prefer early return patterns over nested if.

Use const over let whenever possible.

6. Fixing Errors

To fix all format/lint issues automatically:

pnpm biome check --write .
